## Data Processing

We start by creating a function that takes any general URL (In this example the URL for the 2022 Census Microdata API from Census.gov) and then outputting the result of the GET() function as our URL_id object. After looking at its structure we can see that the raw data is in the content element. 
```{r}
URL_id <- usual_process("https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&for=region:*&SCHL=24")
URL_id
str(URL_id, max.level = 1)
```

Next, we take the output of the GET() function (same output as function above) and turn it into a tibble using the helper function. This function both creates a tibble as well as assigns names that correspond to the requested data. 
```{r}
Census_2022 <- helper(URL_id) 
Census_2022
```
